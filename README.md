The official information on each sections in the application forms can be found:

[Standard Application Form - Connection of Power Generating Modules to DNO Distribution Networks in accordance with EREC G99, Version 9, October 2022](https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/SAF%20v9%20Oct%202022.pdf)

Types of Power Generating Module are defined in Engineering Recommendation G99 and repeated below:
- **Type A:** A Power Generating Module with a Connection Point below 110 kV and a Registered Capacity (ie rating) of 0.8 kW or greater but less than 1 MW.
- **Type B:** A Power Generating Module with a Connection Point below 110 kV and Registered Capacity of 1 MW or greater but less than 10 MW.
- **Type C:** A Power Generating Module with a Connection Point below 110 kV and a Registered Capacity of 10 MW or greater but less than 50 MW.
- **Type D:** A Power Generating Module with a Connection Point at, or greater than, 110 kV; or with a Connection Point below 110 kV and with Registered Capacity of 50 MW or greater.

Distributed Generation Connection Guides Summary for G99:

[Type A](https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/G99%20Type%20A%20Summary%20Guide.pdf)

`
This Guide is written for projects within the scope of EREC G99 Type A, ie the Power Generating Module has a registered capacity greater than 16 A per phase but less than 1 MW.
`

[Type B-D](https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/G99%20Types%20B-D%20Summary%20Guide.pdf)

`
This Guide is written for projects within the scope of EREC G99 Types Bâ€”D, ie the Power Generating Module has a registered capacity greater at or above 1 MW, or is connected at or above 110 kV (in practice in GB this is at 132 kV or above)
`

### Application Forms

[All G99 forms](https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/G99_Amd%209(Oct%2022)_Forms.zip)

#### G99 SGI-1

This process allow the generator to process installation and then submit notification using Form A3-3 (Annex A.1) if conditions in section 6.2.2.2 are met, mainly the Aggregate of Registered Capacities do not exceed 16A.

and also later on:
`
If the Generator wishes to increase the Active Power output of one or more Generating Units comprising the Power Generating Module from its current Registered Capacity such that condition 4 above is no longer satisfied, ie to change or remove the limitation on output, an application in a format as shownin Form A1-1 or Form A1-2 (as applicable and included in Annex A.1) shall be submitted to the DNO
`

#### G99 SGI-2

For Aggregate of Registered Capacities greater than 16A but less than 32A, the generator is required to sumbit Form A1-2 (Annex A.1) to get an approval from DNO/IDNO, before proceeding to installation.
